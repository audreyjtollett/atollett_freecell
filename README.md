# AUDREY TOLLETT FREE CELL SOLITAIRE
I have implemented the standard rules of FreeCell:
52 cards dealt face-up into 8 tableau columns (first four with 7 cards, last four with 6)
4 free cells and 4 foundation piles, all starting empty
Cards can move:
                - To a free cell (if empty)
                - To another tableau pile (alternating color, one rank lower)
                - Or to a foundation pile (same suit, one rank higher)
There is also a super beautiful main menu, and a reset button for during the game and after if you win.
